This is a-very-much-in-progress attempt to create a ui:inputText typeahead component.

Proof-of-concept here, but hopefully will do the following:

1. Definitively find out if anyone else is already done this ;)

and then...

2. Extend ui:inputText, in order to inherit its classes and events
3. Configure for searching on various fields and sObjects, instead of hardcoding to Contact.Name and Contact
